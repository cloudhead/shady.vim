I spend a lot of time coding. I was fed up with all the shiny/vibrant themes,
so I created `shady.vim`. It uses colors sparingly, it gets out of your way.
It's shady.

To fully appreciate it, you'll have to get these syntax files too:

- JavaScript: <http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1491>
- C: <http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=234>
